      <description>Requirements The starting point of this document is based on the following things installed previously:
 Hub clusters ocp ipi baremetal installed (multinode) spoke cluster multinode installed. You could use the deploy.sh script to accomplish this.  Day2 workflow to add worker nodes 1-. Deploy hub cluster (Requirements)
2-. Add bmh crs to hub clusters (in order to deploy spoke cluster multi node) (Requirements)
3-. Finish the spoke cluster installation (multinode 3 nodes)</description>
