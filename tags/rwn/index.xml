      <description>Requirements The starting point of this document is based on the following things installed previously:
 Hub clusters ocp ipi baremetal installed (multinode) spoke cluster multinode installed. You could use the deploy.sh script to accomplish this.  Day2 workflow to add worker nodes 1-. Deploy hub cluster (Requirements)
2-. Add bmh crs to hub clusters (in order to deploy spoke cluster multi node) (Requirements)
3-. Finish the spoke cluster installation (multinode 3 nodes)</description>

      <description>Reference Deploy Folder: https://github.com/RHsyseng/labs-index/tree/master/deploy-rwn-to-ai-using-aicli-api
Scenario Description Once we&amp;rsquo;ve got a 3 master cluster installed with the AI operator, this document is useful to add new remote worker nodes (maybe worker nodes using the same network)
In this case, we&amp;rsquo;ve got 2 possibilities to do that:
 Using the API or maybe an abstraction using AICLI Using the CRD operator (not developed yet)  Requirement We need an environment with:
 Hub deployment ready (UPI,IPI whatever) AI operator + Hive + LocalStorage Cluster 3 multi-node (not possible to do using SNO).</description>
